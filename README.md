# avax-project

This repository contains a notebook (avax-price-forecast.ipynb) for tracking the price of the cryptocurrency Avax of the Avalanche network.
- This notebook features plots of daily price history, seasonal decomposition, and a 30 day price forecast.
- I currently have a SARIMA model as a baseline. I plan to add an experimental LSTM model for tighter predictions to compare against the baseline. 
- I plan to add more robost evaluation and training logic soon as well.
